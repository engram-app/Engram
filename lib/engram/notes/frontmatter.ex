  @moduledoc """
  Pure codec between a note's YAML frontmatter and the structured form stored in
  the CRDT `Y.Map`. No Yex here: split/parse/emit/project are total functions on
  strings and maps so they are trivially testable and reusable.

  Split a note into its frontmatter YAML block (text between the fences, without
  the `---` lines) and its body. Returns `{nil, full_text}` when there is no
  well-formed leading frontmatter (must start at byte 0 and have a closing fence).
